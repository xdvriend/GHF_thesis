The GHF library can be used to run RHF, UHF and GHF calculations. We have provided an interactive IPython Notebook that illustrates the API of the library [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/xdvriend/GHF_thesis/blob/master/notebooks/thesis.ipynb). For local installations, please refer to the [documentation](INSTALL.md)
